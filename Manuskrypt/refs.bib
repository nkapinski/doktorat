It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.",

	abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

	abstract="Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a computational model of human knowledge representation that approximates semantic relatedness judgments. Two issues are discussed that researchers must attend to when evaluating the utility of LSA for predicting psychological phenomena. First, the role of semantic relatedness in the psychological process of interest must be understood. LSA indices of similarity should then be derived from this theoretical understanding. Second, the knowledge base (semantic space) from which similarity indices are generated must contain ``knowledge'' that is appropriate to the task at hand. Proposed solutions are illustrated with data from an experiment in which LSA-based indices were generated from theoretical analysis of the processes involved in understanding two conflicting accounts of a historical event. These indices predict the complexity of subsequent student reasoning about the event, as well as hand-coded predictions generated from think-aloud protocols collected when students were reading the accounts of the event.",

In the medical imaging domain, example tasks include organ segmentation, lesion detection, and tumor classification. The most popular network architecture for deep learning for images is the convolutional neural network (CNN). Whereas traditional machine learning requires determination and calculation of features from which the algorithm learns, deep learning approaches learn the important features as well as the proper weighting of those features to make predictions for new data. In this paper, we will describe some of the libraries and tools that are available to aid in the construction and efficient execution of deep learning as applied to medical images.",

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.",

	abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

	abstract={We address the problem of estimating generalized linear models (GLMs) when the outcome of interest is always observed, the values of some covariates are missing for some observations, but imputations are available to fill-in the missing values. Under certain conditions on the missing-data mechanism and the imputation model, this situation generates a trade-off between bias and precision in the estimation of the parameters of interest. The complete cases are often too few, so precision is lost, but just filling-in the missing values with the imputations may lead to bias when the imputation model is either incorrectly specified or uncongenial. Following the generalized missing-indicator approach originally proposed by Dardanoni et al. (2011) for linear regression models, we characterize this bias-precision trade- off in terms of model uncertainty regarding which covariates should be dropped from an augmented GLM for the full sample of observed and imputed data. This formulation is attractive because model uncertainty can then be handled very naturally through Bayesian model averaging (BMA). In addition to applying the generalized missing-indicator method to the wider class of GLMs, we make two extensions. First, we propose a block-BMA strategy that incorporates information on the available missing-data patterns and has the advantage of being computationally simple. Second, we allow the observed outcome to be multivariate, thus covering the case of seemingly unrelated regression equations models, and ordered, multinomial or conditional logit and probit models. Our approach is illustrated through an empirical application using the first wave of the Survey on Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).},

	abstract="We have developed a novel methodology to combine several models using a Bayesian approach. The method selects the most relevant attributes from several models, and produces a Bayesian classifier which has a higher classification rate than any of them, and at the same time is very efficient. Based on conditional information measures, the method eliminates irrelevant variables, and joins or eliminates dependent variables; until an optimal Bayesian classifier is obtained. We have applied this method for diagnosis of precursor lesions of cervical cancer. The temporal evolution of the color changes in a sequence of colposcopy images is analyzed, and the resulting curve is fit to an approximate model. In previous work we develop 3 different mathematical models to describe the temporal evolution of each image region, and based on each model to detect regions that could have cancer. In this paper we combine the three models using our methodology and show very high accurracy for cancer detection, superior to any of the 3 original models.",

	abstract = {\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Body part recognition is essential in automatic medical image analysis as it is a prerequisite step for anatomy identification and organ segmentation[i],[ii]. Accurate body part classification facilitates organ detection and segmentation by reducing the search range for an organ of interest. As a result, we can quickly and efficiently identify an organ of interest at a higher accuracy when compared to current text-based body part information in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) headers[iii].\&nbsp;Multiple techniques have been developed using multi-class random regression and decision forests to classify multiple anatomical structures ranging from 6-10 organs on tomographic (CT) scans[iv],[v]. These classifiers can discriminate even between similar structures such as the aortic arch and heart1. \&nbsp;However, these prior works focus on a general anatomical body part classification, but organ-specific classification has not been studied for applications such as organ dose estimation.\&nbsp;Accordingly, we present a machine learning powered automatic organ classifier for CT datasets with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by an organ dose calculation. We labeled 16 different organs from axial views of CT images. A 22-layer deep CNN using the NVIDIA Deep Learning GPU Training System (DIGITS) was trained and validated with a 646 CT scan dataset.\&nbsp; The resultant classified organ was automatically mapped to the slab number of a mathematical hermaphrodite phantom to determine the scan range of ImPACT CT dose calculator[vi]. This technique can be used for patient-specific organ dose estimation since the locations and sizes of organs for each patient can be calculated independently, rather than other simulation based methods.\&nbsp;[i] \&nbsp;Yan, Zhennan, Yiqiang Zhan, Zhigang Peng, Shu Liao, Yoshihisa Shinagawa, Shaoting Zhang, Dimitris N.

Experiments on a number of real-world datasets show that our implementation achieves high performance on Intel                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textregistered {\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   Xeon Phi                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}small {\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textsc {\{}tm{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   processors (                                                                                  {\$}{\$}1.1-2.1{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}                   faster than Intel                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textregistered {\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   Xeon                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textregistered {\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   processors) and is up to                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2.1{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}                   faster than existing high-performance incremental algorithms while achieving comparable accuracy.",
