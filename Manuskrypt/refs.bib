	abstract={A new method of two- or three-dimensional spin density imaging by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is proposed, which exploits the properties of spin echoes in time-dependent magnetic field gradients. An analysis shows that simultaneous observation and differentiation of signals, arising from all spins distributed in a plane or set of planes within the specimen, is possible. The method is thus capable of producing visual pictures faster than previously described planar imaging methods.}

It has three times the sensitivity of conventional color Doppler for detection of flow and is particularly useful for small vessels and those with low-velocity flow. Power Doppler sonography shows potential for detecting areas of ischemia in the kidney, brain, and prepubertal testis and for demonstrating hyperemia in areas of inflammation. Its increased sensitivity to motion and flash artifact, however, limits its application in children. Power Doppler is useful as an adjunct to conventional color and pulsed Doppler sonography.",

	abstract="This paper concerns fully automatic and objective measurement of human skeletal muscle fiber orientation directly from standard b-mode ultrasound images using deep residual (ResNet) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Fiber orientation and length is related with active and passive states of force production within muscle. There is currently no non-invasive way to measure force directly from muscle. Measurement of forces and other contractile parameters like muscle length change, thickness, and tendon length is not only important for understanding healthy muscle, but such information has contributed to understanding, diagnosis, monitoring, targeting and treatment of diseases ranging from myositis to stroke and motor neurone disease (MND). We applied well established deep learning methods to ultrasound data recorded from 19 healthy participants (5 female, ages: 30 {\textpm} 7.7) and achieved state of the art accuracy in predicting fiber orientation directly from ultrasound images of the calf muscles. First we used a previously developed segmentation technique to extract a region of interest within the gastrocnemius muscle. Then we asked an expert to annotate the main line of fiber orientation in                                                                           {\$}{\$} 4 {\backslash}times 4 {\$}{\$}                 partitions of 400 normalized images. A linear model was then applied to the annotations to regulate and recover the orientation field for each image. Then we applied a CNN and a ResNet to predict the fiber orientation in each image. With leave one participant out cross-validation and dropout as a regulariser, we were able to demonstrate state of the art performance, recovering the fiber orientation with an average error of just                                                                           {\$}{\$} 2^{\backslash}circ {\$}{\$}                .",

	abstract="In orthopedic surgery, to decide upon intervention and how it can be optimized, surgeons usually rely on subjective analysis of medical images of the patient, obtained from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound or other techniques. Recent advancements in computational performance, image analysis and in silico modeling techniques have started to revolutionize clinical practice through the development of quantitative tools, including patient specific models aiming at improving clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment. Anatomical and surgical landmarks as well as features extraction can be automated allowing for the creation of general or patient specific models based on statistical shape models. Preoperative virtual planning and rapid prototyping tools allow the implementation of customized surgical solutions in real clinical environments. In the present chapter we discuss the applications of some of these techniques in orthopedics and present new computer-aided tools that can take us from image analysis to customized surgical treatment.",

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.",

	abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

	abstract="Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a computational model of human knowledge representation that approximates semantic relatedness judgments. Two issues are discussed that researchers must attend to when evaluating the utility of LSA for predicting psychological phenomena. First, the role of semantic relatedness in the psychological process of interest must be understood. LSA indices of similarity should then be derived from this theoretical understanding. Second, the knowledge base (semantic space) from which similarity indices are generated must contain ``knowledge'' that is appropriate to the task at hand. Proposed solutions are illustrated with data from an experiment in which LSA-based indices were generated from theoretical analysis of the processes involved in understanding two conflicting accounts of a historical event. These indices predict the complexity of subsequent student reasoning about the event, as well as hand-coded predictions generated from think-aloud protocols collected when students were reading the accounts of the event.",

	abstract="Deep learning is an important new area of machine learning which encompasses a wide range of neural network architectures designed to complete various tasks. In the medical imaging domain, example tasks include organ segmentation, lesion detection, and tumor classification. The most popular network architecture for deep learning for images is the convolutional neural network (CNN). Whereas traditional machine learning requires determination and calculation of features from which the algorithm learns, deep learning approaches learn the important features as well as the proper weighting of those features to make predictions for new data. In this paper, we will describe some of the libraries and tools that are available to aid in the construction and efficient execution of deep learning as applied to medical images.",

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.",

	abstract={We address the problem of estimating generalized linear models (GLMs) when the outcome of interest is always observed, the values of some covariates are missing for some observations, but imputations are available to fill-in the missing values. Under certain conditions on the missing-data mechanism and the imputation model, this situation generates a trade-off between bias and precision in the estimation of the parameters of interest. The complete cases are often too few, so precision is lost, but just filling-in the missing values with the imputations may lead to bias when the imputation model is either incorrectly specified or uncongenial. Following the generalized missing-indicator approach originally proposed by Dardanoni et al. (2011) for linear regression models, we characterize this bias-precision trade- off in terms of model uncertainty regarding which covariates should be dropped from an augmented GLM for the full sample of observed and imputed data. This formulation is attractive because model uncertainty can then be handled very naturally through Bayesian model averaging (BMA). In addition to applying the generalized missing-indicator method to the wider class of GLMs, we make two extensions. First, we propose a block-BMA strategy that incorporates information on the available missing-data patterns and has the advantage of being computationally simple. Second, we allow the observed outcome to be multivariate, thus covering the case of seemingly unrelated regression equations models, and ordered, multinomial or conditional logit and probit models. Our approach is illustrated through an empirical application using the first wave of the Survey on Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).},

The method selects the most relevant attributes from several models, and produces a Bayesian classifier which has a higher classification rate than any of them, and at the same time is very efficient. Based on conditional information measures, the method eliminates irrelevant variables, and joins or eliminates dependent variables; until an optimal Bayesian classifier is obtained. We have applied this method for diagnosis of precursor lesions of cervical cancer. The temporal evolution of the color changes in a sequence of colposcopy images is analyzed, and the resulting curve is fit to an approximate model. In previous work we develop 3 different mathematical models to describe the temporal evolution of each image region, and based on each model to detect regions that could have cancer. In this paper we combine the three models using our methodology and show very high accurracy for cancer detection, superior to any of the 3 original models.",

	abstract = {\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Body part recognition is essential in automatic medical image analysis as it is a prerequisite step for anatomy identification and organ segmentation[i],[ii]. Accurate body part classification facilitates organ detection and segmentation by reducing the search range for an organ of interest. As a result, we can quickly and efficiently identify an organ of interest at a higher accuracy when compared to current text-based body part information in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) headers[iii].\&nbsp;Multiple techniques have been developed using multi-class random regression and decision forests to classify multiple anatomical structures ranging from 6-10 organs on tomographic (CT) scans[iv],[v]. These classifiers can discriminate even between similar structures such as the aortic arch and heart1. \&nbsp;However, these prior works focus on a general anatomical body part classification, but organ-specific classification has not been studied for applications such as organ dose estimation.\&nbsp;Accordingly, we present a machine learning powered automatic organ classifier for CT datasets with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by an organ dose calculation. We labeled 16 different organs from axial views of CT images. A 22-layer deep CNN using the NVIDIA Deep Learning GPU Training System (DIGITS) was trained and validated with a 646 CT scan dataset.\&nbsp; The resultant classified organ was automatically mapped to the slab number of a mathematical hermaphrodite phantom to determine the scan range of ImPACT CT dose calculator[vi]. This technique can be used for patient-specific organ dose estimation since the locations and sizes of organs for each patient can be calculated independently, rather than other simulation based methods.\&nbsp;[i] \&nbsp;Yan, Zhennan, Yiqiang Zhan, Zhigang Peng, Shu Liao, Yoshihisa Shinagawa, Shaoting Zhang, Dimitris N.

Such implementations can be very inefficient for online streaming applications demanding real-time guarantees, as the inclusion of each new data point requires retraining of the model from scratch. This paper focuses on the high-performance implementation of an accurate incremental SVM algorithm on Intel                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textregistered {\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   Xeon Phi                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}small {\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textsc {\{}tm{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   processors that efficiently updates the trained SVM model with streaming data. We propose a novel cycle break heuristic to fix an inherent drawback of the algorithm that leads to a deadlock scenario which is not acceptable in real-world applications. We further employ intelligent caching of dynamically changing data as well as other programming optimization ideas to speed up the incremental SVM algorithm. Experiments on a number of real-world datasets show that our implementation achieves high performance on Intel                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textregistered {\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   Xeon Phi                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}small {\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textsc {\{}tm{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   processors (                                                                                  {\$}{\$}1.1-2.1{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}                   faster than Intel                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textregistered {\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   Xeon                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}tiny {\backslash}textregistered {\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   processors) and is up to                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2.1{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}                   faster than existing high-performance incremental algorithms while achieving comparable accuracy.",
